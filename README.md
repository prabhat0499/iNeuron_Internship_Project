Flight Fare Prediction
Problem Statement: Travelling through flights has become an integral part of todayâ€™s lifestyle as more and more people are opting for faster travelling options. The flight ticket prices increase or decrease every now and then depending on various factors like timing of the flights, destination, and duration of flights various occasions such as vacations or festive season. Therefore, having some basic idea of the flight fares before planning the trip will surely help many people save money and time. The main goal is to predict the fares of the flights based on different factors available in the provided dataset.

Life Cycle of the particular Data Science Project:
EDA [Exploratory Data Analysis]
Feature Engineering
.....
Data Preprocessing:
Importing the required libraries
Importing the dataset
Handling the missing data
Encoding categorical data
Splitting the dataset into Training and Test set
Feature Scaling
Data Preprocessing and Exploratory data analysis are almost same but they are different in a way that EDA is more about Exploring data in a broder way like graphs and charts.

Q. What are Categorical Variables ?

Categorical variables are those values in a dataset that contains differet "unique categories".
Categorical Variables are of two types:
Nominal variables: Unordered variables which doesn't have any sense of Order. For Example:

male/female
smoker/non-smoker
sunny/cloudy/rainy/windy/icy (There is no logic to rank windy before sunny)
yes/no or True/False
NOTE: USE ONE HOT ENCODING.
Ordinal variables: Ordered variables which have some sense of order or rank or notion of order. For Example:

Education level(BE,ME,Phd)
Shirt size(XS,S,M,L,XL)
1/2/3/4/(minimal/moderate/severe/unbearable pain)
NOTE: USE LABEL ENCDOING
